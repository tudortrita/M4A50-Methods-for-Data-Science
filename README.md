M4A50 Methods for Data Science (2019-2020) at Imperial College London

#### Folders:
- cw1: Coursework 1 graded at 89%. Introduction to data analysis, regression and classification. First task involves data cleaning and exploration. Second task explores performing regression using Linear and Ridge Regression as well as classification using Logistic Regression and Na√Øve Bayes.
- cw2: Coursework 2 graded at 95%. Exploring supervised Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and Neural Network models for classification on noisy data.
- cw3: Coursework 3 graded at TBC. Exploring unsupervised graph methods, K-Means and comparison with supervised Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network as well as Convolutional Neural Network. Final CNN achieves an out of sample accuracy of approximately 92% on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. Mastery part focuses on dimensionality reduction using PCA, Negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF) as well as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
